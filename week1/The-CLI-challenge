1- How do I create a hidden file or folder ? How I display it in the CLI ?

To create hide file we can use “touch .<file name >” by add (.) before the name of file
Ex: touch .test.txt 

To create hide folder we can use “mkdir .<directory_name>” by add (.) before the name of folder

To display the hidden files & folders in CLI we use “ls -a”.


2- How do I create multiple nested directories ?

mkdir -p these/folder/just/for/fun


3- How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character ?

We can use :  echo <text> >> <file_name>
Ex : echo Hello I’am George >> test.txt . 

And to put the sentences next to each other we use “echo -n <text> >> <file_name>”.

* we can use printf “<text>” >> <file_name>
And to make newline character we use “\n”

Ex : prientf “Hi , I am George \n This is my homework” >> text.txt
